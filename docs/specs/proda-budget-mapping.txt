Last Updated: 2024-07

OVERVIEW
--------
PRODA (Provider Registration and Online Directories and Agreements) is the
Australian Government's identity verification and authentication system used
to access NDIS provider portals. It is used by:
  - NDIS registered providers
  - Plan managers
  - Support coordinators (to submit claims on behalf of plan-managed participants)

The NDIS myplace provider portal is accessed via PRODA credentials.

This document outlines how PRODA service bookings and claims map to the
CRM budget tracking system.

PRODA / myplace BUDGET STRUCTURE
----------------------------------
The myplace provider portal organises NDIS funding using the same 15 support
categories as PACE, but with a focus on service bookings and payment claiming.

Key PRODA concepts:

SERVICE BOOKINGS
  - A service booking is a commitment of funds between a participant plan
    and a specific provider for a specific support category
  - Created by either the provider or the support coordinator
  - Reserves funds from the participant's plan budget
  - Can be created for a fixed amount or for a specified period

SERVICE BOOKING TYPES
  - Flexible: Provider can claim up to the booked amount, within the date range
  - Fixed: For specific supports with fixed dates/quantities

PAYMENT CLAIMING
  - Providers submit payment requests against service bookings
  - Claims are processed by the NDIS (usually within 3-5 business days)
  - Claims include: support item number, quantity, unit price, service date

PRODA SUPPORT CATEGORY NUMBERS
--------------------------------
The following category numbers are used in PRODA/myplace portal:

Category | Name                                          | Budget Type

PRODA CRM FIELD MAPPING
------------------------
CRM Field                      | myplace/PRODA Field
-------------------------------|----------------------------------
service_bookings.ndis_booking_number  | Service Booking Number
service_bookings.allocated_amount     | Service Booking Amount
service_bookings.remaining_amount     | Remaining Service Booking Amount
service_bookings.booking_start_date   | Service Booking Start Date
service_bookings.booking_end_date     | Service Booking End Date
plan_line_items.claim_status          | Payment Request Status
plan_line_items.invoice_number        | Provider Invoice / Reference Number
ndis_payment_requests.claim_reference | NDIS Claim Reference Number
providers.provider_number             | Provider NDIS Registration Number

REGISTRATION GROUPS
--------------------
PRODA uses Registration Groups to categorise the types of supports a provider
is registered to deliver. A provider must hold registration in the relevant
group to be paid by the NDIS (for agency-managed participants).

Key registration groups relevant to support coordination:
  0107 - Specialist Support Coordination
  0134 - Support Coordination
  0133 - Management of Funding (Plan Management)
  0119 - Therapeutic Supports
  0105 - Assistance with Daily Personal Activities
  0125 - Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA)
  0136 - Group and Centre Based Activities

CRM INTEGRATION WITH PRODA
---------------------------
The CRM does not directly integrate with PRODA (NDIS API access required).
Instead, the CRM:

1. Stores service booking numbers entered manually by coordinators
2. Tracks budget commitments based on service agreement values
3. Records payment status based on invoices received
4. Flags discrepancies between CRM committed amounts and PRODA bookings

MANUAL SYNC WORKFLOW
---------------------
Step 1: Coordinator logs into NDIS myplace via PRODA credentials
Step 2: Checks service booking balance for participant
Step 3: Updates CRM service booking record with current PRODA balance
Step 4: CRM calculates: Available = Plan Budget - Committed - Paid

PRODA CLAIM STATUS VALUES
--------------------------
CRM Status       | PRODA Status        | Description
-----------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------
pending          | Not submitted        | Invoice received, not yet claimed in PRODA
submitted        | Submitted            | Claim submitted in myplace/PRODA
approved         | Payment approved     | NDIA has approved the payment
rejected         | Payment rejected     | NDIA rejected - reason must be recorded
paid             | Payment made         | Funds transferred to provider
cancelled        | Claim cancelled      | Claim withdrawn by provider

COMPLIANCE NOTES
----------------
- Support coordinators must not have access to providers' PRODA accounts
- Claims must match the support item, date, quantity and price agreed in service booking
- Short notice cancellations: claimable only if cancellation policy included in service agreement
- Provider travel: claimable only if agreed in service booking and within price guide limits
- Non-face-to-face: limited to specific support items, requires documentation
