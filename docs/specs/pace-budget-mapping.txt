OVERVIEW
--------
PACE (Planning and Carer Expenses) is the NDIS's internal planning and budget
management system. From 2023 onwards, NDIS is transitioning participants to
the PACE system which replaces the legacy myplace portal for plan management.

This document outlines how NDIS support categories and budgets are structured
within PACE and how the CRM maps to PACE budget categories.

PACE BUDGET STRUCTURE
----------------------
PACE organises NDIS funding into three high-level budgets:

1. CORE SUPPORTS BUDGET
   Flexible funding for everyday supports.
   Participant can move funding between Core categories (except Transport).

   Category 01 - Assistance with Daily Life
     - Personal care, in-home support, supported independent living (SIL)
     - High intensity daily personal activities
     - Community nursing care
     - Household tasks

   Category 02 - Transport
     - Transport to access community, education, employment
     - NOTE: Transport budget is FIXED - cannot be shifted to other Core categories

   Category 03 - Consumables
     - Everyday use items required due to disability
     - Continence products, wound care, low-cost AT items (<$1,500 typically)

   Category 04 - Assistance with Social, Economic and Community Participation
     - Group activities, day programs, community access
     - Innovative community participation

2. CAPITAL SUPPORTS BUDGET
   For higher-cost items and modifications. Quotes usually required.
   NOT flexible - must be used for the specific approved purpose.

   Category 05 - Assistive Technology
     - Equipment to help with daily tasks (wheelchairs, communication devices, etc.)
     - Maintenance, repair and rental of AT

   Category 06 - Home Modifications
     - Modifications to home to support independent living
     - Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA)

3. CAPACITY BUILDING BUDGET
   Supports to build skills and independence.
   Generally NOT flexible between capacity building categories.

   Category 07 - Support Coordination
     - Support Coordination (general)
     - Specialist Support Coordination (for complex needs)

   Category 08 - Improved Living Arrangements
     - Assistance to find suitable housing

   Category 09 - Increased Social and Community Participation

   Category 13 - Improved Life Choices
     - Plan management (if participant chooses plan managed)
     - Self-management support

   Category 14 - Improved Daily Living Skills
     - Therapies: OT, speech, psychology, physiotherapy, behaviour support
     - Most common capacity building category

   Category 15 - Improved Relationships
     - Positive behaviour support, social skills programs

PACE CRM FIELD MAPPING
-----------------------
CRM Field                    | PACE Field Name
-----------------------------|----------------------------
plan_id                      | NDIS Plan ID
plan_start_date              | Plan Start Date
plan_end_date                | Plan End Date
allocated_amount (per cat)   | Approved Budget Amount
spent_amount (per cat)       | Paid Claims Amount
committed_amount (per cat)   | Committed Service Bookings
pace_category_code           | Support Category Number
management_type              | Plan Managed / Agency Managed / Self Managed

BUDGET FLEXIBILITY RULES
-------------------------
Core Budget:
  - Can move between Cat 01, 03, 04 within Core budget
  - Cat 02 Transport is FIXED - separate sub-budget
  - Cannot move Core funds to Capital or CB

Capital Budget:
  - AT and Home Mods are separate line items
  - Cannot move to Core or CB

Capacity Building:
  - Each CB category is generally separate
  - Some plans allow flexibility within CB (participant-specific)
  - Cannot move CB funds to Core or Capital

PACE vs LEGACY MYPLACE DIFFERENCES
------------------------------------
NOTE: PACE is actively replacing the legacy myplace portal. During transition,
some participants remain on legacy myplace while newer participants are on PACE.
Always confirm which system applies to each participant's plan.

Feature                | Legacy myplace         | PACE (new system)
-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------------
Budget visibility      | Real-time              | Updated every 24-48 hours
Service bookings       | Provider creates       | Coordinator or Provider creates
Payment timing         | 3-5 business days      | Up to 5 business days
Plan management        | Separate portal        | Integrated in PACE
Claiming               | myplace provider portal| PACE provider portal
Participant view       | myplace app            | NDIS app (updated)

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------
- When displaying budget balances, always note last-sync timestamp
- Warn users that PACE balances may be up to 48 hours delayed
- Always check the relevant NDIS portal (PACE or legacy myplace, depending on
  the participant's plan) for real-time balance before creating large service bookings
- CRM balance = approved amount minus paid claims minus committed service bookings
